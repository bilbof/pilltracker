# Pilltracker

This is a simple app to help keep track of pills. I recently parted ways with my appendix, and left the hospital with a bunch of different pills to take at odd intervals to help with recovery. The spreadsheet I was given to keep track of the pills isn't so useful so I wrote this up to help me.
